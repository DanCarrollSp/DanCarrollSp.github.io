		<h2 id="1">What is Gaming?</h2>
		<p>Gaming in reference to video games, is the act of playing digital video games. <br><br>
		A video game/computer game is an eletronic game that requires inputs from a user(player) through an input device such as a controller or keyboard and mouse. <br><br>
		The players inputs generate visual feedback through a television screen or monitor based on those inputs to simulate control over the playable character and world 				surrounding them.</p>

		<h2 id="2">Origin of Gaming</h2>
		<p>Ideas for Video Games began being designed in 1950-1970. <br><br>
		The first actual consumer available Video Game was Computer Space in 1971, paving the way for more popular games like Pong and Space Invaders. <br> <br>
		In 1983 there was an industry crash for Video Games in America, following this the market became dominated by Japan for years to come, of which the influences can still 			be seen in modern Gaming</p>

		<h2 id="3">Current state of Gaming</h2>
		<p>Gaming is the most popular it has ever been, with 2.7 billion Gamers as of 2020, and an expected increase of 100 million per year. <br><br>
		Most Gamers are know as 'Casual' Gamers, who periodically take part in mobile or console gaming, such as Candy Crush or Fifa. <br><br>
		On the opposite side of the spectrum, competitive Gamers have brought Esports to life, a competitive competition for Gamers to compete with each other across a variety 			of games to win cash prizes. Usually taking place on PC</p>

		<h2 id="4">The Gaming Industry</h2>
		<p>Today the Gaming Industry is worth more than the Music and Movie Industries <strong>Combined</strong> being worth almost 300 billion in 2020. <br><br>
		It is also the fastest growing entertainment industry, expected to be worth 400 billion by 2026 <br><br>
		The Industry, like most, is mainly dominated by large corporations, however great indie titles produced by smaller teams exist and always will due to practically Zero 				barriers to entering the Industry. </p>

		<h2 id="5">Influencers in Gaming</h2>
		<p><strong>Youtube</strong> - Gaming wasn't a popular topic on youtube until the invention of the 'Let's Play' format in 2011. Since then Gaming has been one of the most 			popular content on most media sharing sites. <br><br>
		<strong>Twitch</strong> - Many indie games owe their popularity to Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, as Streamers are always expolring new content to keep their 				audiences entertained, leading them to play unconventional or not yet well known games. <br><br>
		Both platforms have popularized and normalized Gaming in society today.</p>

		<h2 id="6">Gamings affects on society</h2>
		<p>Gaming is in the media often, protrayed as desensitizing young adults and teens to violence by people who've likely never played a Video Game in their life. <br><br>
		Infact Violence, drug abuse and many other self destructing and harmful behavours and activities have been on a steady decline since the introduction of Gaming as a Past 			time. <br><br>
		Whether or not these things are corilated however is of course up for debate, but it is something that should be taken into consideration. </p>
